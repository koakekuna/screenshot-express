# Screenshot Express
Node app that screenshots websites using Microsoft's [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)

## Introduction
For those that have used Google's [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), Playwright enables you to do the same thing - programmatically controlling an instance of a browser. But instead of just Chromium, we can now automate all major browsers including Firefox, WebKit, and the new Microsoft Edge!

For now this repo is just a playground to test Playwright and it's API, but the goal is to eventually become a full fledged visual regression testing app.

## But Support?
Yea, it's still very much early days, but most(?) of the devs that created Puppeteer are now on this project now, so it should be relatively stable soon. They even have a website dedicated to tracking tests - [Is Playwright Ready?](https://aslushnikov.github.io/isplaywrightready/)
